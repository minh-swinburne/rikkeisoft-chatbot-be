This created a fragile market that was vulnerable to sudden changes.\n3. **Weakening economy**: The economy was already showing signs of weakness in 1929, with declining industrial production, rising unemployment, and a slowdown in construction.\n4. **Credit crisis**: Many investors had bought stocks on margin, and when the market began to decline, they were unable to pay back their loans, leading to a credit crisis.\n5. **Banking system weaknesses**: The banking system at the time was fragile, and many banks had invested heavily in the stock market. When the market crashed, these banks found themselves with large losses, leading to widespread bank failures.\n\nThe immediate trigger for the crash was a **sharp decline in stock prices** on Thursday, October 24, 1929 (Black Thursday), which led to a wave of panic selling on Friday, October 25, and Monday, October 28. On Tuesday, October 29 (Black Tuesday), stock prices plummeted, with some stocks losing up to 50% of their value in a single day.\n\nSources:\n* \"A History of the American People\" by Paul Johnson\n* \"The Great Crash, 1929\" by John Kenneth Galbraith\n* \"The Stock Market Crash of 1929\" by the Federal Reserve History website.'),('01945e7a-2afd-7b26-bd6e-5e2dc00cdf7e','f0033470-99d2-4aa1-af8a-79b9e29e9dbf','2025-01-13 14:04:12','user','What is my birthday?'),('01945e7a-2e0f-7db0-b119-76d4cb0e493b','f0033470-99d2-4aa1-af8a-79b9e29e9dbf','2025-01-13 14:04:13','assistant','I don\'t have any information about your birthday.

Environment variables: You can override individual settings by setting environment variables, such as AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.\n4. The AWS CLI cache: When you use a shared profile that specifies an IAM role, the AWS CLI calls the AWS STS AssumeRole operation to retrieve temporary credentials, which are then stored in the AWS CLI cache.\n\nHere is the list of relevant document:\n* Configuration and credential file settings in the AWS CLI by Minh Nguyen, created on 2025-02-09, can be accessed through <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html\" target=\"_blank\">Preview</a> and <a href=\"https://rikkeigpt-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/50cb94b2-4a01-4978-b550-0c9dd7bb2b40.html?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3DConfiguration%20and%20credential%20file%20settings%20in%20the%20AWS%20CLI%20-%20AWS%20Command%20Line%20Interface.html&AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAXNGUVTVY5YXQBPIQ&Signature=Zxt9ggiAaPySEyoqt%2BQSPgqyrpM%3D&x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIf%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDmFwLXNvdXRoZWFzdC0yIkcwRQIhAOiW360OpE5A5tInjkKW9Vglz5rZhSl4SJi5ATvs7oJ6AiBEVqnc8pl1w5w2DESjCo%2FHC5FYeRzBdaUvOPIqBLvAVyqHBAig%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAAaDDUwOTM5OTYzNzM2MSIM1LVLxMcdG45dH3MOKtsDycHPbeqU%2FMT7lMginyge%2F4Ds8719O8Lzet1%2BF0OwF%2FuDTBU3yfwjqon%2F7xiS1W6HpUbRColED1TWDFWWCp3tzTK2aE%2B0NuBBIZXyljbKFn1%2FVgG1X4B%2BPJuXeAkDNd4VBswdRjePWiPI0pGHQEwemV%2Figkp1TpEIxgBbhm0upKwIssPnVOQy%2Fhm0UeNlZ14U0fZ7ZdExjpptOULxJqDTKOY2g6EAUVJZk%2FGOp%2FCG4J0CuaO2kLcMEYI1HAMvhopdW1qSph8%2FWSx7PuS6Z167e7gz4oqT0tdAkaKpXdmjUeqj2EdZmqU1GTsK16v3S0H5D42mIKqGdV5fZJawsnitO6QIoAeNugWqEC1PVBx8Lo9MvDZFVL1r94UyFW1nSgYo9NU6iOLKghoHAXOIDFJvL0aEs74nB0H109cFntJPxJrCwzciP5Y8crZN3wumxdOIN8HgU4O9eo%2BP7uOI6epvIA0L9W1jKA1bisXu6pWuPDvT6ipLsiFMJNoTqsCHih6W%2BI1FPz45sK0f12nSnYjb0AbgGYMwvDSwsh0HrciLPoN0FQKk%2BalCkEdTTf5L3Rp0v%2BptE6Lu%2BStTj89iSnqxklbjNuLwhdk8o0PnT%2F9w3RZYOw0ehTBwpFy%2FHzDIraG9BjqlAXo%2FzpHxGEWg7OqR3xrBE6P3IDBNcsJjEsElFmtfol9IRbG7k9BpdPsqEyHchRW6W46M3D7yTSmVlgrPknVxXfFhyyXKiWceFg9d20sMayihp9rAdeGV8kN%2FJd7Z7es2jqVD898e28h8P81qdB2KHwVpbefpoJUWx4xA4SRFOwtj%2BAUdZkmsxT6yi%2BD7UMxLqmThjvxLbHVKbzrbyFBI9M60ZOkDaw%3D%3D&Expires=1739096389\" target=\"_blank\">Download</a> \n\nPlease let me know if you would like to know more about this document or if there\'s anything else I can help you with.'),('0194eadc-9fce-726c-b010-499ba134fea7','0194eadc-9a12-7cc2-9824-4e6f821d7403','2025-02-09 13:18:35','user','who making you ?'),('0194eadc-a87c-7122-beaf-fb5d6544dbd8','0194eadc-9a12-7cc2-9824-4e6f821d7403','2025-02-09 13:18:37','assistant','I was created by a team of developers using a range of technologies, including natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.

You can do this by eating smaller portions, skipping unhealthy snacks, and avoiding high-calorie foods.\n2. **Eat a balanced diet**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Aim to include a variety of colors on your plate to ensure you\'re getting a range of nutrients.\n3. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help control hunger and boost metabolism.\n4. **Incorporate physical activity**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week. You can also incorporate strength training, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and other forms of physical activity to help you lose weight and maintain weight loss.\n5. **Get enough sleep**: Poor sleep can disrupt hormones that regulate hunger and fullness, leading to overeating and weight gain. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.\n6. **Manage stress**: Chronic stress can lead to emotional eating and weight gain. Try stress-reducing techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n\nRemember, losing weight too quickly is not healthy and is unlikely to be sustainable. Aim for a slow and steady weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week.\n\nReferences:\n* None\n\nPlease note that I couldn\'t find any relevant documents in the provided context that specifically address weight loss.
