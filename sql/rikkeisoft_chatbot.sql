Some of the key events and conditions that contributed to the crash include:\n\n1. **Overproduction and underconsumption**: In the 1920s, there was a surge in industrial production, but many Americans were unable to afford the goods being produced, leading to a mismatch between supply and demand.\n2. **Speculation and margin buying**: Many investors bought stocks on margin (using borrowed money), hoping to make a quick profit. This created a fragile market that was vulnerable to sudden changes.\n3. **Weakening economy**: The economy was already showing signs of weakness in 1929, with declining industrial production, rising unemployment, and a slowdown in construction.\n4. **Credit crisis**: Many investors had bought stocks on margin, and when the market began to decline, they were unable to pay back their loans, leading to a credit crisis.\n5. **Banking system weaknesses**: The banking system at the time was fragile, and many banks had invested heavily in the stock market. When the market crashed, these banks found themselves with large losses, leading to widespread bank failures.\n\nThe immediate trigger for the crash was a **sharp decline in stock prices** on Thursday, October 24, 1929 (Black Thursday), which led to a wave of panic selling on Friday, October 25, and Monday, October 28. On Tuesday, October 29 (Black Tuesday), stock prices plummeted, with some stocks losing up to 50% of their value in a single day.\n\nSources:\n* \"A History of the American People\" by Paul Johnson\n* \"The Great Crash, 1929\" by John Kenneth Galbraith\n* \"The Stock Market Crash of 1929\" by the Federal Reserve History website.'),('01945e7a-2afd-7b26-bd6e-5e2dc00cdf7e','f0033470-99d2-4aa1-af8a-79b9e29e9dbf','2025-01-13 14:04:12','user','What is my birthday?'),('01945e7a-2e0f-7db0-b119-76d4cb0e493b','f0033470-99d2-4aa1-af8a-79b9e29e9dbf','2025-01-13 14:04:13','assistant','I don\'t have any information about your birthday.
